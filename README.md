This has some miscellaneous neural network-based codes - from GNNs for molecular property prediction to recurrent NNs.

GNN_QM9 - Implementation of graph neural networks (GNNs) with invariance/equivariance for predicting molecular properties using the QM9 dataset.

NN for trig - Design and implementation of a very simple neural network for approximating an analytical trigonometric function.
